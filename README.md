# Data Grabber ðŸ“ŠðŸ¤›
A Python-based library of scripts for efficient data aggregation. Most API's that handle large datasets have limits on the volume and quantity of API calls. DataGrabber scripts DO NOT circumvent these limits, but rather aims to minimize the volume/quantity of necessary API calls, maximizing the usage of the allocated calls. 

### Features
- **Data Efficiency**:
      - When a user has data that they want to update old data gets reused [functionality IP: Doesnt reuse old data if dividends/splits occured between the time 
           
### Dependencies
To run properly you must provide api keys for chatGPT and NewsAPI
```bash
pip install textblob
pip install yfinance --upgrade --no-cache-dir 
```
### How to Run
Either simply run 
- Example:
  ```bash
  python YF.py
  ```

### Future Developments
- **Performance**: 

### Contributions
Gunnar Balch: Designed and developed the DataGrabber lib, integrating APIs, writing scripts, and refining algorithms for efficient data aggregation.
