# Data Grabber ðŸ“ŠðŸ¤›
A Python-based library of scripts for efficient data aggregation. Most API's that handle large datasets have limits on the volume and quantity of API calls. DataGrabber scripts DO NOT circumvent these limits, but rather aims to minimize the volume/quantity of necessary API calls, maximizing the allocated calls.
